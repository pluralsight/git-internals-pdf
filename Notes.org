* Notes about this and the workflow

** The aim is to work 'on the move.'

Woking on the __iPad__, this promises to be a useful tool that has all the 
necessary to do this kind ofwork.

For example, mathematic language to express comprehensions. Again,
more tools. Math, a language itself. The computer programming language
'R', which appears with a lean-to-wards statistics.

## Git

Git as a tool to collaborate. The Hub-of-Git as a service to supply
an infrastructure for this.
