* Notes about this and the workflow

** The aim is to work 'on the move.'

Woking on the __iPad__, this promises to be a useful tool that has all the 
necessary to do this kind ofwork.
What is this about? About building tools. More tools. About concepts.
For example, mathematic language to express comprehensions. Again,
more tools. Math, a language itself. The computer programming language
'R', which appears with a lean-to-wards statistics.

## Git

Git as a tool to collaborate. The Hub-of-Git as a service to supply
an infrastructure for this.

## And as a Review of the Org Morg

- [ ] There are task lists for the Org Mode - revies this in Emacs
- [x] This task line is in existence to to illustrate the tick boxing
- [ ] review, and stick to, the policies

OK. Make the above task list into an issue.
