h2. The Treeish

Besides branch heads, there are a number of shorthand ways to refer to particular objects in the Git data store.  These are often referred to as a _treeish_.  Any Git command that takes an object - be it a commit, tree or blob - as an argument can take one of these shorthand versions as well.

I will list here the most common, but please read the 
"rev-parse command":http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-rev-parse.html
for full descriptions of all the available syntaxes.

h4. Full SHA-1

code. dae86e1950b1277e545cee180551750029cfe735

You can always list out the entire SHA-1 value of the object to reference it.  This is sometimes easy if you're copying and pasting values from a tree listing or some other command.

h4. Partial SHA-1

code. dae86e 

Just about anything you can reference with the full SHA-1 can be referenced fine with the first 6 or 7 characters.  Even though the SHA-1 is always 40 characters long, it's very uncommon for more than the first few to actually be the same.  Git is smart enough to figure out a partial SHA-1 as long as it's unique.

h4. Branch or Tag Name

code. master

Anything in _.git/refs/heads_ or _.git/refs/tags_ can be used to refer to the commit it points to.

h4. Date Spec 

code. master@{yesterday}
master@{1 month ago}

This example would refer to the value of that branch yesterday. Importantly, this is the value of that branch _in your repository_ yesterday.  This value is relative to your repo - your 'master@{yesterday}' will likely be different than someone else's, even on the same project, whereas the SHA-1 values will _always_ point to the same commit in every copy of the repository.

h4. Ordinal Spec

code. master@{5}

This indicates the 5th prior value of the master branch.  Like the _Date Spec_, this depends on special files in the _.git/log_ directory that are written during commits, and is specific to _your_ repository.

h4. Carrot Parent

code. e65s46^2
master^2

This refers to the Nth parent of that commit.  This is only really helpful for commits that merged two or more commits - it is how you can refer to a commit other than the first parent.

h4. Tilde Spec

code. e65s46~5 

The tilde character, followed by a number, refers to the Nth generation grandparent of that commit.  To clarify from the carrot, this is the equivalent commit in caret syntax:

code. e65s46^^^^^

!vector/Treeish.eps!

h4. Tree Pointer

code. e65s46^{tree}

This points to the tree of that commit.  Any time you add a @^{tree}@ to any commit-ish, it resolves to its tree.

h4. Blob Spec

code. master:/path/to/file

This is very helpful for referring to a blob under a particular commit or tree.
