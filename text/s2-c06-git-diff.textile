h2. Git Diff

Git has a great diff utility built in that can give you statistics or a patch file given any combination of tree objects, working directory and index.

Two common uses of this include seeing what you've worked on but not committed yet, and creating a patch file to send to someone over email (though there is a much preferred way to do that which we will learn about in the "distributed workflow" section a bit later).

h3. What has changed?

If you simply run 'git diff' with no arguments, it will show you the differences between your current working directory and my index, that is, the last time I ran 'git add' on my files.  For example, if I add my email to the README file and run it, I will see this:

.shell git-diff-readme.txt

You can also use 'git diff' to show you some spiffy stats for a diff, rather than a patch file, if you want to see a wider overview of what changed, then drill down into specific files later.  Here are some examples getting stats, the first for the differences between two commits and the second a summary between a commit and the current HEAD.

.shell git-diff-stat.txt

If you want to see what the specific difference is in one of those files, you can just add a path limiter to the diff command.

.shell git-diff-file.txt

You can use this command to detect changes between your index and any tree, or your working directory and any tree, your working directory and your index, etc.
