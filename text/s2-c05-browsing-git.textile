h2. Browsing Git

Git also gives you access to a number of lower level tools that can be used to browse the repository, inspect the status and contents of any of the objects, and are generally helpful for inspection and debugging.

h3. Showing Objects

The @git show@ command is really useful for presenting any of the objects in a very human readable format.  Running this command on a file will simply output the contents of the file.  Running it on a tree will just give you the filenames of the contents of that tree, but none of its subtrees.  Where it's most useful is using it to look at commits.

h4. Showing Commits

If you call it on a tree-ish that is a commit object, you will get simple information about the commit (the author, message, date, etc) and a diff of what changed between that commit and its parents.

shell. git-show-commit.txt

h4. Showing Trees

Instead of the @git show@ command, it's generally more useful to use the lower level @git ls-tree@ command to view trees, because it gives you the SHA-1s of all the blobs and trees that it points to.

shell. git-lstree1.txt

You can also run this command recursively, so you can see all the subtrees as well.  This is a great way to get the SHA-1 of any blob anywhere in the tree without having to walk it one node at a time.  

shell. git-lstree2.txt

The @-t@ makes it also show the SHA-1s of the subtrees themselves, rather than just all the blobs.

h4. Showing Blobs

Lastly, you may want to extract the contents of individual blobs.  The @cat-file@ command is an easy way to do that, and can also serve to let you know what type of object a SHA-1 is, if you don't know.  It is sort of a catch-all command that you can use to inspect objects.

shell. git-catfile.txt

With those basic commands, you should be able to explore and inspect any object in any git repository relatively easily.

h3. Graphical Interfaces

There are two major graphical interfaces that come with Git as tools to browse the repository.

h4. Gitk

A very popular choice for browsing Git repositories is the Tcl/Tk based browser called @gitk@.  If you want to see a simple visualization of your repository, @gitk@ is a great tool.

Gitk will also take most of the same arguments that @git log@ will take, including @--since@, @--until@, @--max-count@, revision ranges and path limiters.  One of the most interesting visualizations that I regularly use is @gitk --all@, which will show all of your branches next to each other (rather than just the one you are currently on).

h4. Instaweb

If you don't want to fire up Tk, you can also browse your repository quickly via the @git instaweb@ command.  This will basically fire up a web server running the "gitweb":http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Gitweb CGI script using lighttpd, apache or webrick.  It then tries to automatically fire up your default web browser and points it at the new server.

shell. git-instaweb.txt

When you are done, you can run the following to shut down the server:

shell. $ git instaweb --stop

This is a quick way to throw up a web interface on your git repository for sharing with others or simply browsing it in a different way.  

For a more long term web interface to your repository, you can put the gitweb Perl files that come with Git into your @cgi-bin@ directory.
