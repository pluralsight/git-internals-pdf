h2. The Care and Feeding of Git

Git requires a bit of tender loving care from time to time.  It may seem a bit odd, but occasionally you should run a few commands on your repositories to make sure they're healthy and running as quickly as possible.

h3. garbage collection

The @git gc@ command is an important one to remember.  It will pack up your objects into the delta-compressed format, saving you a lot of space and seriously speeding up several commands.

shell. git-gc.txt

If can turn gc'ing automatically on and off by setting a configuration setting to '1' or '0':

shell. $ git config --global gc.auto 1

This will make git automatically gc itself occasionally.  You may want to setup a cron to do this at night, however, as it can take a while sometimes on really large repositories.

h3. fsck and prune

If you want to check the health of your repository, you can run 'git-fsck', which will tell you if you have any unreachable or corrupted objects in your database and help you fix them.

shell. git-fsck.txt

Which you can then remove with 'git-prune' (you can run it with '-n' first to see what it will do)

shell. git-prune.txt
