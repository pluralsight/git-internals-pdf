h2. Tagging

As we previously covered, creating a tag in Git is much like making a branch.  A tag in Git serves is basically a signed branch that never moves - it is simply an arbitrary string that points to a specific commit.

For example, if you wanted to tag your code base every time you released to production or created a new binary to release, you would run something like this:

shell. $ git tag -a v0.1 -m 'this is my v0.1 tag'

As we recall from section one, that command will create a git object that looks something like this:

!vector/Tag_Expand.eps!

and will store that in the '.git/objects/' directory and then will create a permanent reference to it in '.git/refs/tags/v0.1' that contains the SHA-1 of that tag.

Then you can use that as a reference to that commit at any time in commands like 'diff' or 'archive' (see next chapter).

h3. Lightweight Tags

You can also create a tag that doesn't actually add a Tag object to the database, but just creates a reference to it in the '.git/refs/tags' directory.  If you run the following command:

shell. $ git tag v0.1

Git will create the same file as before, '.git/refs/tags/v0.1', but it will contain the SHA-1 of the current HEAD commit itself, not the SHA-1 of a Tag object pointing to that commit.  Unlike object Tags, these can be moved around easily, which is generally undesirable.

h3. Signed Tags

At the other end of the tagging spectrum, you can sign Tag object with a GPG key to ensure its cryptographic integrity.  Replacing '-a' with '-s' in the command will create a Tag object and sign it with the current users email address GPG key.  If you want to specify a key, you can run it with '-u' instead:

shell. $ git tag -u <key-id> v0.1 -m 'the 0.1 release'

Then, you or others can later verify that signed tag with a '-v'

shell. $ git tag -v v0.1
